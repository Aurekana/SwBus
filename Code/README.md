# Code

Code files for the "arduino" board and the prototype profile for the motor controller.

## LED Controller "Arduino"

The "arduino" (Trinket M0) is programmed in CircuitPython, so included in this directory is the main.py file only. The user of this code will also need to supply the NeoPixel, time, DigitalIO, and math libraries.

## Motor Controller

The motor controller can be configured via the Pololu Motor Control App: https://www.pololu.com/product/1363/resources

Near as I can tell this program is available only for Windows, and I did not have any luck running it under Wine. The profile can be uploaded via this program; check the user guide for additional info.
