# LED distribution board

Board and schematic files for the LED distribution board. 

Board purpose is to break out the signals from the slip-ring to the ten (10) barrels while avoiding a mess of wires that I'd been prone to end up with in prior projects. The board also incorporates signal resistors and power smoothing capacitors, and contains ten (10) handy connectors so that the building of the barrel assemblies can be done at a later stage.

This particular design uses a 1-wire Neopixel protocol as well as +5V and GND lines. Because I was space constrained I found some JST connectors that would fit, and since I needed to sent a lot of current (~1A) to each barrel and the wire gauge of the wire assemblies I found was so small (I hate making my own crimped wire assemblies), the +5V and GND are connected over two wires and the signal takes the middle wire.

To anyone reading this, a 3 or 4 pin connector would be a lot easier to connect and route so long as the wire gauge can handle ~1A per connector per +5V/GND line.
