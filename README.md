# Sweet Business Autorifle from Destiny 2

Presented as-is, your mileage may vary greatly. All these parts "should" work as they were used for a prototype and a second prototype, but those prototypes were fairly expensive. In the BOM I've attempted to add alternative sources or other options where applicable. Otherwise, modifications welcome and wanted, though if you use these files please attribute to me, see the LICENCE file (CC-BY-4.0). I worked hard on making these (~6 months).
